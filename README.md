## What is "GameOn"

GameOn is my third web project and first one using JS.

It's a frontpage of a fictionnal esport tournament organisation.

## What's the purpose

During my web development training within the [openclassroom cursus](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/314-developpeur-front-end).
I had to fix existing code and had full JS support to the form.

## Usage

It's only html/css/js just open the index.html file.
